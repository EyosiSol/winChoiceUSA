      The initial installation was awesome. The contractor use was great and did
      a very thorough professional job. One window was improperly measured and
      didn’t fit. The contractor covered the opening and took proper
      measurements. He told us they would have to make another window. Next day
      I checked with customer service and they verified it was in process with
      the factory and it would be about 30 days. Customer service followed
      through and scheduled the installation which took about 30 minutes. We
      couldn’t be more pleased with the entire process. We grade WinChoice as an
      A+.
